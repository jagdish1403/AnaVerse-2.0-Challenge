# AnaVerse 2.0 - Data Science Hiring Drive
**Organized by:** Celebal Technologies  
**Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Status:** Completed (24-Hour Kaggle Challenge)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my solution for the AnaVerse 2.0 Hiring Drive hosted on Kaggle. The challenge required building a predictive model within a strict 24-hour window, simulating a real-world high-pressure environment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle Kernel

## 🚀 My Approach
As a CS student specializing in AI/ML, I followed a structured pipeline to ensure model robustness:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed statistical analysis and visualization to identify feature correlations and data distribution.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and performed feature scaling.
3. **Modeling:** Implemented regression/classification algorithms (similar to my previous work in House Price Prediction and Restaurant Recommendation systems).
4. **Validation:** Used cross-validation to ensure the model generalized well to the private leaderboard.

## 📊 Key Results
- Developed an end-to-end pipeline from raw data to final submission in under 24 hours.
- Focused on feature engineering to boost model performance.
